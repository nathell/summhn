# Autosummarized HN

This is Hacker News with one-sentence summaries automatically generated by GPT-3.

## Running it

### Prerequisites

You’ll need [Clojure CLI tools][0]. You also need to have access to [the OpenAI API][1].

 [0]: https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure
 [1]: https://openai.com/api/

### Steps

1. (Optional) Edit the configuration. The defaults should work out-of-the-box, except that some links will point to [my deployed instance][2].
2. In your terminal, run the following (substitute the key with your own, which you can get from [OpenAI’s dashboard][3]):
```bash
OPENAI_KEY=[sk_your_key] clojure -X summhn.core/run
```

## Notes

This code uses my [Skyscraper][4] library to fetch and cache the data. Successfully running this code will produce a Skyscraper cache in `~/skyscraper-data`.
